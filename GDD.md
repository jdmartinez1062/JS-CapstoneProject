# High Concept
Galaga is a 2D shooter arcade game where players go through un-ending waves of ever-increasing enemies.

# Gameplay

The player will shoot enemies that appear at random spots on the screen. The enemies will remain still and will shoot at fixed intervals. 

## Victory Conditions

There are no victory conditions.  The objective of the game is to last as much as one can to achieve a higher score

## Art

The game art must be pixel art and the highest resolution of said art must not exceed 32 bits. The background must be black with stars and animations to give the player the sensation of moving through the game. 


## Technical Aspects
